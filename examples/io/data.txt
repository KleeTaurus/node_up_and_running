Readable streams

The readable stream API is a set of methods and events that provides access to
chunks of data as they are sent by an underlying data source. Fundamentally,
readable streams are about emitting data events. These events represent the
stream of data as a stream of events. To make this manageable, streams have a
number of features that allow you to configure how much data you get and how
fast.

The basic stream in Example 4-16 simply reads data from a file in chunks. Every
time a new chunk is made available, it is exposed to a callback in the variable
called data. In this example, we simply log the data to the console. However,
in real use cases, you might either stream the data somewhere else or spool it
into bigger pieces before you work on it. In essence, the data event simply
provides access to the data, and you have to figure out what to do with each
chunk.
